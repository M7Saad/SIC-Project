1-Data Split:
The data was divided into three sections: Training, Testing, and Validating.

2-Data Preprocessing:
Image loading, processing, and augmentation were performed using ImageDataGenerator.

3-Model Building and Training:
A model was built from scratch.
The model was trained using the training data.

4-Model Comparison:
The performance of the from-scratch model was compared to other models.
The goal was to find the best suitable learning rate and drop rate.
The efficientnet_v2 model was determined to be the best one.

5-Evaluation Metrics:
The following evaluation metrics were performed:
Accuracy: Measure of how well the model predicts the correct class labels.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix that shows the performance of a classification model.
Loss Rate: Measurement of the error between predicted and actual values.
Drop Rate: A metric that indicates the rate of dropped connections or accuracy degradation.
